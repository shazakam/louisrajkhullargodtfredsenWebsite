                        <p>I started my first year of University in Hong Kong far away from my cold yet comfortable hometown of Oslo. I was
                            in the School of Engineering orignally planning on studying Electrical Engineering. However, with time and a growing 
                            interest for programming encouraged by my computer science Professors I decided to leave my original plan and move towards
                            a mathematics and computer science focused career. Due to my lack of foresight and also knowledge of Hong Kongs particular 
                            political situation, I failed to realise the potential disruption to my studies produced by the protests. Although not
                            significantly bothering me in the beginning with every passing week there was a growing tension on campus and in the city. 
                            I decided to leave after the death of one of our own students as well as the partial riot/destruction of our campus 
                            overlooking the ocean. The reason I chose Hong Kong is due to my desire to explore asia. I am half asian, yet, I have rarely
                            travelled or explored Asia in the slightest and nothing compared to the extent I have travelled around Europe. I plan on returning
                            at some point in the future when circumstance favours it. Despite the tumultous environment, I made friends, clashed with cultures,
                            partied, learnt and grew alongside an array of people from all walks and places in life.<br>
                            My time there was pivotal to forming my desired future and set me on the track for a more dedicated and focused career.
